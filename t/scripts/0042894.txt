Long-term_effects_of_radiotherapy_and_bromocriptine_treatment_in_patients_with_previous_surgery_for_macroprolactinomas._The_long-term_effect_of_radiotherapy_and_bromocriptine_treatment_was_retrospectively_evaluated_in_25_patients_who_had_previously_undergone_transsphenoidal_surgery_for_treatment_of_macroprolactinomas._Surgery_had_reduced_the_median_serum_prolactin_(PRL)_value_from_613_micrograms/l,_a_reduction_of_53%._Postoperative_bromocriptine_was_administered_to_21_of_the_25_patients._In_14_of_these_patients,_serum_PRL_values_became_normal_or_almost_normal_with_medication._There_were_no_radiological_or_ophthalmological_signs_of_progressive_tumor_growth_during_bromocriptine_treatment._Fourteen_patients_received_postoperative_radiotherapy._After_withdrawal_of_bromocriptine_in_13_of_these_patients_an_average_of_7_years_after_radiotherapy,_the_median_serum_PRL_value_had_further_decreased_by_95%._The_PRL_reduction_was_similar_for_all_doses_applied,_38_to_52_Gy._After_withdrawal_of_bromocriptine_in_8_patients_not_receiving_radiotherapy_an_average_of_7_years_after_operation,_the_median_serum_PRL_level_had_further_decreased_by_75%._At_follow-up,_18_additional_instances_of_pituitary_insufficiency_had_developed_in_the_group_receiving_radiotherapy,_compared_with_8_cases_of_insufficiency_in_the_group_not_receiving_radiotherapy._Thus,_because_bromocriptine_has_a_long-standing_effect_on_prolactin_secretion,_and_radiotherapy_is_associated_with_a_notably_high_incidence_of_pituitary_insufficiency,_we_propose_that_photon_irradiation_should_be_considered_mainly_for_patients_who_are_not_candidates_for_surgical_or_medical_treatment.
