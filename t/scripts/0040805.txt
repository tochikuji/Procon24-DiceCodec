A_population-based_study_on_the_incidence_and_survival_rates_of_3857_glioma_patients_diagnosed_from_1953_to_1984._Intracranial_glioma_was_diagnosed_during_the_patient's_life_and_histologically_verified_in_3857_patients_between_1953_and_1984_in_Finland._Their_survival_up_to_the_end_of_1987_was_analyzed,_the_follow-up_being_complete._The_treatment_was_by_operation_in_1193_cases,_radiation_in_459_cases,_both_operation_and_radiation_in_1486_cases,_and_neither_operation_nor_radiation_in_719_cases._The_1-year,_5-year,_10-year,_and_15-year_cumulative_relative_survival_rates_were_0.53,_0.29,_0.20,_and_0.18,_respectively._The_newborn_to_14-year-olds_lost_56%_of_their_life_expectancy;_the_15-year-olds_to_44-year-olds,_71%;_the_45-year-olds_to_64-year-olds,_88%;_and_the_65-year-olds_to_99-year-olds,_91%._According_to_the_model_with_the_best_fit_in_regression_analysis_the_prognosis_was_significantly_better_among_young,_recently_diagnosed_patients_who_had_undergone_both_operation_and_radiation.
