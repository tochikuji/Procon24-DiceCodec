Percutaneous_endoscopic_gastrostomy_and_early_mortality._To_assess_morbidity,_mortality,_and_benefit_associated_with_percutaneous_endoscopic_gastronomy_(PEG),_we_retrospectively_studied_42_patients_who_had_had_PEG._Mortality_was_exceptionally_high_during_the_first_60_days_after_PEG_(43%),_and_then_stabilized._In_nearly_half_of_the_cases_(20/42)_the_PEG_tube_was_removed_during_the_first_60_days_because_of_either_death_or_improvement._Patients_with_malignancy_had_a_significantly_higher_morbidity_and_60-day_mortality_than_the_neurologically_impaired._We_concluded_that_patients_should_be_carefully_selected_for_PEG_because_early_mortality_is_high;_a_60-day_trial_of_soft_nasogastric_feedings_should_be_considered_before_PEG,_and_could_reduce_by_nearly_half_the_number_of_patients_failing_to_receive_long-term_benefit;_and_patients_with_malignancy_have_significantly_greater_morbidity_and_mortality_after_PEG_and_may_not_receive_the_same_advantage_from_the_procedure.
