Costs_and_health_consequences_of_cholesterol_screening_for_asymptomatic_older_Americans._To_predict_the_consequences_of_cholesterol_screening_among_elderly_Americans_who_do_not_have_symptoms_of_heart_disease,_we_explore_the_cost_implications_of_a_cholesterol_screening_program,_evaluate_evidence_linking_hypercholesterolemia_to_coronary_heart_disease_and_mortality_in_the_elderly,_and_describe_the_likely_effects_of_therapy_of_hypercholesterolemia._According_to_our_calculations,_if_all_Americans_65_years_of_age_and_older_adhered_to_a_cholesterol_screening_program_similar_to_the_one_proposed_by_the_National_Cholesterol_Education_Program,_minimum_annual_expenditures_for_screening_and_treatment_would_be_between_$1.6_billion_and_$16.8_billion,_depending_on_the_effectiveness_of_diet_and_the_cost_of_the_medications_used_to_treat_hypercholesterolemia._There_is_no_direct_evidence_that_this_program_would_lessen_overall_morbidity_or_extend_the_lives_of_elderly_Americans.
