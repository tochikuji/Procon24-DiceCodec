Endoscopic_removal_of_inflammatory_fibroid_polyps_of_the_stomach._Three_cases_of_gastric_inflammatory_fibroid_polyp_removed_by_endoscopic_polypectomy_are_reported._All_lesions_were_located_in_the_gastric_antrum_or_prepyloric_region,_and_their_depth_was_restricted_to_the_submucosa._The_correct_diagnosis_was_obtained,_and_the_digestive_symptoms_disappeared_after_polypectomy._In_contrast_to_observations_in_previous_reports,_we_believe_these_lesions_are_suitable_for_removal_by_endoscopic_means,_provided_they_are_small_in_size_and_strictly_submucosal_in_location.
